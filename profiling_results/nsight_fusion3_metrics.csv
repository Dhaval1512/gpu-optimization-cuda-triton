A read from constant memory costs one memory read from device memory only on a cache miss; otherwise, it just costs one read from the constant cache. Immediate constants are encoded into the SASS instruction as 'c[bank][offset]'. Accesses to different addresses by threads within a warp are serialized, thus the cost scales linearly with the number of unique addresses read by all threads within a warp. As such, the constant cache is best when threads in the same warp access only a few distinct locations. If all threads of a warp access the same location, then constant memory can be as fast as a register access.

A read from constant memory costs one memory read from device memory only on a cache miss; otherwise, it just costs one read from the constant cache. Immediate constants are encoded into the SASS instruction as 'c[bank][offset]'. Accesses to different addresses by threads within a warp are serialized, thus the cost scales linearly with the number of unique addresses read by all threads within a warp. As such, the constant cache is best when threads in the same warp access only a few distinct locations. If all threads of a warp access the same location, then constant memory can be as fast as a register access.
